# American Defense Alliance Website

> A full-stack web application powering the digital presence of the American Defense Allianceâ€”a U.S. startup supporting defense contractors, government agencies, and national security stakeholders through high-impact industry events.

## Overview

This platform serves as the central hub for all ADA-hosted events, including conference overviews, sponsorships, registration links, speaker rosters, and multimedia recaps. It replaces a legacy no-code prototype with a performant, scalable, and fully custom event infrastructure.

## Features

- ðŸ”§ **Dynamic Event Architecture**  
  Each event is dynamically generated from structured TypeScript data filesâ€”pages include overview, registration options, speaker lineups, agendas, and sponsorship packages.

- ðŸ§¾ **Speaker Management System**  
  Speaker data is ingested from Google Sheets via a custom ETL pipeline and curated manually into per-event rosters using a reusable schema.

- ðŸ“¥ **Internal Admin Tools**  
  Admin portal allows non-technical staff to upload speaker presentation PDFs directly to S3 for event distribution.

- ðŸ’¡ **Post-Event Media Galleries**  
  Photo/video galleries with lightbox functionality and testimonial content, built for engagement and social proof.

- ðŸš€ **Performance-Oriented Delivery**  
  Assets delivered via CloudFront CDN and S3, optimized for low latency across the U.S. audience.

## Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router) + React  
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS  
- **Language**: TypeScript  
- **Infra**: AWS (CloudFront, S3), Vercel  
- **Tooling**: Git, Neovim, custom CLI scripts

## Architecture Overview

- All event data is stored in structured TypeScript files, which are used for dynamic rendering. These files are stored under `src/constants`.
- These files are _not_ fully typed, and honestly a little messy! Watch for inconsistencies in the data structure. I hope to clean them up in the future. This was my first TypeScript project, and I learned a lot about the language and its ecosystem while building this site.
- Each event page is located at `/events/[slug]/page.tsx`.
- Static assets are stored in S3 and served via CloudFront CDN. Generally speaking locally I use `aws s3 sync` to upload files to S3, and then use the CloudFront invalidation API to clear the cache. This is a bit of a pain, but it works.

## Future Plans

- **Event Registration System**  
  Integrate a registration system for attendees to sign up for events, including payment processing and ticketing.
- **Schedule Printing**  
  Add a feature to automatically generate a printable schedule for each event, including all sessions and speakers. This will use data from `src/constants/schedules.ts`.
- **Speaker Management System**  
  Build a more robust speaker management system that allows for easy editing and updating of speaker information, including bios, photos, and presentation materials.
- **A real DB/CMS**  
  Integrate a real database or CMS for event data management, allowing for easier updates and content management. I still need to think more about what this might look like, and if it would be worth it.
- **Improved Admin Tools**  
  Build out the admin portal to include more features for managing events, speakers, and media. This will include a more robust upload system for speaker presentation PDFs, as well as a way to manage event details and schedules.
