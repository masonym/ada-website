	<br></br>
	During his time in Afghanistan, Mike led the teams searching for deserter Pvt. Bowe Berghdal.

	<br></br>
	Mike’s servant leadership continued in the White House, as well as the Pentagon, as a defense policy director for Secretaries of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates. He also advised the Bush Administration on policy he then carried out in the military.
