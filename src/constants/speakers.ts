                position: "Chairman, Subcommittee on Readiness and Member, Subcommittee on Strategic Forces and Subcommittee on Intelligence and Operations, and Task Force on Critical Supply Chain, House Armed Services Committee; and Member, House Foreign Affairs Committee and Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence",
                company: "U.S. House of Representatives",
                bio: `
                Congressman Mike Waltz is a Colonel (Ret.) in the National Guard, a combat-decorated Green Beret, former White House and Pentagon policy advisor, a small business owner, an author, and a proud father. He is the first Green Beret to be elected to Congress.
                Mike was born in Boynton Beach, Florida and grew up in Jacksonville, Florida. He was raised by a hard-working single mother and is the son and grandson of Navy Chiefs.
                Mike has served his country his entire life. He graduated from the Virginia Military Institute with Honors and served 27 years in the U.S. Army and National Guard, retiring during his second term in Congress. After being commissioned as an Army lieutenant, Mike graduated Ranger School and was selected for the elite Green Berets, serving worldwide as a Special Forces officer with multiple combat tours in Afghanistan, the Middle East and Africa. For his actions in combat, Mike was awarded four Bronze Stars, including two for Valor.
                <br></br>
                During his time in Afghanistan, Mike led the teams searching for deserter Pvt. Bowe Berghdal. Mike was one of the first to publicly call into question then-President Obama’s labeling of Berghdal as a hero and has continued to lead the call for justice on behalf of all the service-members Berghdal’s desertion put in harm's way.
                <br></br>
                Mike’s servant leadership continued in the White House, as well as the Pentagon, as a defense policy director for Secretaries of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates. He also advised the Bush Administration on policy he then carried out in the military.
                <br></br>
                His experiences as a soldier and a policy advisor inspired him to write the book, “Warrior Diplomat: A Green Beret’s Battles from Washington to Afghanistan,” the proceeds of which continue to benefit the Green Beret and Matthew Pucino Foundations. He also wrote a children’s book, “Dawn of the Brave,” a Christian children's book that teaches children the importance of service.
                <br></br>
                Following his time in the White House, Mike built a small business to over 400 employees, which was repeatedly listed in the Inc. 500 index as one of the fastest-growing private companies in America.
                <br></br>
                A former Fox News Channel contributor, Mike, provides expert commentary on foreign policy, defense, and business issues to viewers around the world.
                <br></br>
                Mike is determined to be part of the new generation of leadership in Congress: Servant leaders who lead by example with their values and deliver results. 
                <br></br>
                As the Chairman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness and member of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee and House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Mike has championed legislation to restore our military back to be merit-based and mission-focused.
                <br></br>
                Mike serves on the House China Task Force with 15 Republican lawmakers representing 14 committees of jurisdiction to coordinate policy on China. Mike sponsored legislation to reduce American reliance on Chinese critical minerals and pioneered legislation to secure American universities and academies from Chinese espionage.
                <br></br>
                As a Floridian, Mike has fought to help maintain Florida’s way of life, introducing legislation to help prevent harmful algae blooms and keep Florida’s water clean, and protect Florida’s farmers and growers. He is a strong advocate for school choice and a return to civics in education. He has also championed the growing space industry on Florida’s Space Coast and the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) programs at Florida’s universities.
                <br></br>
                His commitment in Washington, D.C. is the same now as it was in combat: To serve with everything he has, without regard for his own self and with a sense of duty.
                <br></br>
                Mike has a daughter in college and a baby boy. He is married to Dr. Julia Nesheiwat, a combat veteran who served in multiple presidential administrations, as well as most recently as Homeland Security Advisor to President Trump. They live in St. Johns County, Florida.

                name: "Honorable John P. (\"Sean\") Coffey",
                position: "General Counsel",
                company: "Department of the Navy",
                bio: `
                John P. (“Sean”) Coffey was sworn into office on February 16, 2022, as the 24th General
                Counsel of the Department of the Navy after his confirmation by the U.S. Senate on
                February 9, 2022. As General Counsel, Mr. Coffey is the Department of the Navy’s
                (DON) Chief Legal Officer and head of the Office of the General Counsel (OGC). He
                leads more than 1,100 attorneys and professional support staff in 140 offices
                worldwide. DON OGC provides legal advice to the Secretary of the Navy, the Under
                Secretary of the Navy, the Assistant Secretaries of the Navy, their staffs, and the multiple
                components of the Department, including the Navy and the Marine Corps.
                <br></br>
                In addition to managing OGC’s traditional legal services to its many DON clients, Mr.
                Coffey has launched several initiatives intended to advance DON financial, readiness,
                and personnel interests. For example, the Taxpayer Advocacy Project (TAP) seeks to
                leverage legal authorities and strategies to ensure that the DON is obtaining the
                maximum return on taxpayer investments from contractual counterparties. The
                Promoting Individual Accountability (PINACL) project directs the DON’s Suspension
                and Debarment Officers to identify and if appropriate sanction individuals who cause
                DON vendors to engage in fraud or grossly poor performance. Mr. Coffey has worked
                closely with the Judge Advocate General of the Navy and Staff Judge Advocate to the
                Commandant of the Marine Corps in implementing historic changes to the military
                justice system intended to combat sexual misconduct in the DON, including the
                establishment of each Services’ Office of Special Trial Counsel. Mr. Coffey initiated the
                in-depth review of the World War Two-era “Port Chicago” courts-martial, which
                culminated with Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro setting aside the convictions and
                sentences of 256 African-American Sailors wrongfully convicted in those 1944 trials.
                <br></br>
                A native of New York City, Mr. Coffey is the oldest of seven children born to Irish
                immigrants. He is an honors graduate of the United States Naval Academy and
                Georgetown University Law Center. After graduating from Annapolis, Mr. Coffey
                completed Naval Flight Officer training and served eight years on active duty, including
                assignments as a P-3C Orion mission commander hunting Soviet submarines during the
                Cold War, a junior officer intern to the Strategy Division in the Organization of the Joint
                Chiefs of Staff, and the special military assistant (personal aide) to Vice President George
                H.W. Bush. Mr. Coffey attended Georgetown Law’s evening program while assigned to
                the Pentagon and White House. After graduating from Georgetown, Mr. Coffey
                transitioned to the Navy Reserve and returned to New York, where he practiced law for
                over thirty-five years, including several years as an Assistant United States Attorney in
                the Southern District of New York and most recently as Chair of Complex Litigation at
                Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP.
                <br></br>
                After leaving active duty, Mr. Coffey continued to serve in the Navy Reserve for eighteen
                years. Among other things, he flew anti-submarine missions in the North Atlantic and
                Mediterranean, counter-narcotics missions in the Caribbean, and armed missions in
                support of the blockade of the former Yugoslavia. Mr. Coffey was selected to serve as
                commanding officer both of a reserve P-3C squadron (VP-92) and the reserve component
                of the Enterprise carrier battle group staff (CCDG-12), and served as a staff officer in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (Reserve Affairs). Mr. Coffey retired at the rank of
                Captain in 2004.
                <br></br>
                Prior to returning to public service, Mr. Coffey served as the President of the Federal Bar
                Foundation and on the boards of various non-profit organizations, including ThanksUSA,
                Common Cause New York, Georgetown Law’s Board of Visitors, and the Holocaust and
                Human Rights Education Center. Mr. Coffey has been married for over thirty years to
                Anne Churchill, an actress whose credits include This is Spinal Tap. They have three
                grown children.
